# Troubleshooting WWDC MCP

The public tracker covers public WWDC, Apple Developer documentation and Swift research. Start with the symptom, not a guessed root cause.

## Connection fails

Confirm which MCP client you use and the exact public MCP endpoint configured by the product. Capture the error type and time without access tokens, authorization headers, private URLs or cookies. Distinguish an MCP transport failure from GitHub issue-tool authorization. Do not paste logs without reviewing them for secrets.

## A tool returns an incorrect or missing result

Record the exact tool name, sanitized query, expected outcome and observed outcome. Where practical, cite a public primary source or repeatable sample. If the result depends on private user/provider state, route to [private product support](https://wwdcmcp.smatdesigns.com/support) and do not publish the state.

## Known limitation or stale documentation

Search the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/jabbertones-cloud/wwdc-support/issues?q=is%3Aissue) first. For outdated sources, provide a public source URL and date. Do not treat past evidence as proof of current provider behavior.

## File or respond to an issue

Open [New issue](https://github.com/jabbertones-cloud/wwdc-support/issues/new/choose), choose the bug form and include minimal reproduction details. An agent with the official GitHub MCP can search, read, create when authorized and comment. If GitHub is disconnected, the agent should return a draft instead of claiming it posted one.

WWDC MCP is independent of Apple, uses public research material only and cannot access private App Store Connect accounts. Include a public Apple URL when documenting source drift.
